Project Description

The Automated Pet Feeder System is designed to dispense pet food at scheduled intervals, monitor food consumption, and alert the user if any issues occur (e.g., food not dispensed, food not eaten). This project aims to make pet care more convenient and reliable, ensuring pets are fed on time even when the owner is away.

## Features

**Scheduled Feeding:** Automatically dispenses food at pre-defined times.

**Food Level Monitoring:** Checks if the food bin is empty before dispensing.

**Portion Control:** Dispenses exact food quantity as per configuration.

**Consumption Monitoring:** Detects if the pet has eaten the food.

**Alerts:** Sends notifications if food is not dispensed or not consumed.

**Manual Override:** Allows manual feeding in addition to automated schedules.

## Usage

1. Set feeding schedules in the system configuration.
2. Fill the food bin.
3. Turn on the feeder system.
4. The feeder will automatically dispense food at the scheduled times.
5. Monitor notifications for any feeding issues.
6. Use manual override if needed for additional feeding.
